++ Description ++

Ohm's Law Calculator is a mobile application which allows you to use the Ohm's law formula ( E = I / R ) to calculate the voltage, current, resistance, or resistance value of any single resistor in a circuit. A value of -1 designates an unknown value.

Ohm's Law Calculator  is currently only available on Android. However, ports to Windows Phone 7, webOS, and iOS are planned.
